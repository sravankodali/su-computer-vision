Some cool work I did under a mentor in the Syracuse University Bioinformatics Research Group.

1) Computed average distances between points in convex and concave polygons using a ray-tracing algorithm:

Where black points are determined to be within the vertices and gray points are not. Moreover, the program can calculate the average distance to a specified order of magnitude with time complexity O(N^2).
